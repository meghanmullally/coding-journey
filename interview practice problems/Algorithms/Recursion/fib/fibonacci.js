// Fibonacci Sequence
// The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. 
// The sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

// Write a JavaScript function to generate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

// Example: fib(4) === 3

function fib(n) {
    // code goes in here
}

module.exports = fib;
